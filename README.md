Serving js files from a publicly available [CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network) has clear benefits:

* **Speed**: Users will be able to download jQuery from the closest physical location.
* **Caching**: CDN is used so widely that potentially your users may not need to download jQuery at all.
* **Parallelism**: Browsers have a limitation on how many connections can be made to a single host. Using a CDN for jQuery offloads a big one.
